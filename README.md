BinaryBody is an N-body simulation comparison application forming the basis of my final year Honours project.
The application is built in Python, is CLI-based and allows the user to compare a naive Pairwise Interaction Algorithm and Barnes-Hut Quadtree against one another.
The number of bodies can be entered by the user for different results.


The user can launch either the Pairwise or Barnes-Hut quadtree via the main.py file, and once a simulation is chosen, they will be prompted to enter the number of bodies to insert into the simulation. 

Once this has been done, the program will display how long it took to complete the simulation, based on the number of bodies contained.
