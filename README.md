BinaryBody is an N-body simulation comparison application forming the basis of my final year Honours project.
The application is built in Python, is CLI-based and allows the user to compare a naive Pairwise Interaction Algorithm and Barnes-Hut Quadtree against one another.
The number of bodies can be entered by the user for different results.
