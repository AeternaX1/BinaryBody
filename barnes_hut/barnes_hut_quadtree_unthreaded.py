Barnes-Hut Algorithm
3 steps
1. Engineer a quadtree 
2. For each particle, traverse the quadtree to a sufficient depth. This gives you the center of masses to which you need to calculate distances, and so this step gives you the acceleration on each particle.
3. Numerically integrate using your algorithm of choice. (Velocity Verlet, Euler, whatever.)
